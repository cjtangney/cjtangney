# Howdy.

You've found the repository for [cjtangney.me](https://cjtangney.me) -- my personal website. Right now, I am just putting random things that I develop on here (React components, etc), but I am scheming to eventually put some other stuff on here.

## Some candidates for that "other stuff" include:

- [ ] My resum√® / credentials
- [x] My photography
- [ ] Sim racing videos
- [x] ~~Shouting into the void~~
- [ ] Blog posts

## Site improvements I want to add

- [ ] scroll to top component
- [ ] scroll-hint component (let user know to scroll down)
- [ ] modal component (npm?)
